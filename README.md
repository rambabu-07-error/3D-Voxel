* 3D Voxel-Based Room Model Scanning Using ARCore and Depth API (Android)
Welcome to the 3D Voxel-Based Room Model Scanning project! ðŸŽ‰

This project allows you to scan real-world rooms in 3D using Android's ARCore and Depth API, then visualize the space as a voxel-based 3D model.

* Overview
Using ARCore and Depth API, this Android application captures the depth and surface data of a room, converts it into a voxel-based model, and visualizes it in real-time. This voxel representation is ideal for applications such as augmented reality, architectural visualization, or interior design.

* Features
  
  * ARCore Integration: Surface detection, motion tracking, and environment understanding.
  * Depth API Support: Depth data collection for detailed 3D scanning.
  * Voxel-Based 3D Models: Converts depth data into a voxel grid for simplified 3D representation.
  * Real-Time Visualization: See the voxel grid as you scan the room in real-time.
  * Kotlin: Modern, efficient Android app development with Kotlin.
* Tech Stack
  
  * Kotlin: The programming language used for Android development.
  * ARCore: Handles motion tracking and surface detection.
  * Depth API: Collects depth information to generate the 3D model.
  * Android SDK: Built for Android SDK 24+.
* Usage
  * Run the App: Launch the app on an ARCore and Depth API-supported device.
  * Scan the Room: Move the device around to scan the environment, while ARCore tracks surfaces and the Depth API collects depth data.
  * View the 3D Model: The app will display a voxel grid representation of the scanned room in real-time.
